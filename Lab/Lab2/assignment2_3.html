    <h1>DCS - 2.3 Curve parametrization</h1>
    <p> The following illustration shows a cycloid curve of radius 30 rolling along the x-axis during 5 periods. We are going to discuss now how to obtain a parametrization for such a curve. </p>

    <p> The cycloid is the curve traced by a point on a circle as it rolls along a straight line (the x-axis, in this case) without slipping, as it is suggested in the following animation, which shows a period of the cycloid curve.  </p>

    <p> As we have already said, let's suppose that the line on which the circumference rolls is the x-axis, that the circumference has radius R and that the point whose movement we are going to follow is initially at the origin, O. 
    Notice that after the circle has rolled through an angle &#952, it is tangent to the line at T, and the point whose trajectory we are following will have moved to position P, as it is shown in the following figure. </p>

    <p> Now, note that as there is no slip, we can write the following equalities: </p>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?segment(OT)=arc(PT)=R\theta" title="segment(OT)=arc(PT)=R\theta" class="center"/>
    <p> Let PQ be a segment perpendicular to TC, as in the figure above. If the coordinates of P are (x, y), then we can write the following pair of equations for the x and y coordinates of P: </p>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x=OT-PQ=R\theta&space;-Rsin(\pi&space;-\theta)=R\theta-Rsin(\theta)" title="x=OT-PQ=R\theta -Rsin(\pi -\theta)=R\theta-Rsin(\theta)" class="center"/>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=TC&plus;CQ=R&plus;Rcos(\pi-\theta)=R-Rcos(\theta)" title="y=TC+CQ=R+Rcos(\pi-\theta)=R-Rcos(\theta)" class="center"/>
    <p> Therefore, the parametric equation of the cycloid curve is just: </p>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\gamma=(R(\theta-sin(\theta)),R(1-cos(\theta)))" title="\gamma=(R(\theta-sin(\theta)),R(1-cos(\theta)))" class="center"/>
